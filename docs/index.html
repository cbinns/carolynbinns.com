            <h2 class="title" id="about">About me</h2>
                    <p>Originally from Winnipeg Manitoba I moved to Edmonton Alberta witih my family in 2002. I graduated from Jasper 
                        Place High School in 2014 and started my undergraduate degree in the fall of 2014 at the University of
                         Alberta. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am a 4th year undergraduate student studying at the University of Alberta working towards
                        a double major in Computing Science and Psychology and plan to graduate in 2018. Why Psychology and Computer Science?
                        There truely seems to be a gap in the computing world between the technical side of development and the human
                         side of development and the user's we are developing for. Human Factors should play a big role in the development 
                         process. My understanding of human psychology allows me to bridge this gap and improve communicationa and
                          aid development and increase customer satisfaction.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am the vice president of the Univeristy of Alberta's Squash Club and a level 1 squash coach. In my
                        spare time I play in the Edmonton Squash League and like to practice guitar and hang out with friends.

                    <p>
                        I spent summers of high school working at Camp Wohelo during the summer as a senior camp councilor on Pigeon Lake.

                    <p>
                        I also spent time working for Abinsi Solutions Group doing data entry and website refinement.

                     <p>I believe I would be an asset to your team. I can work effectivly alone but prefer to work
                         collectively with others towards a shared project.
